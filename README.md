# Custom Team Services Agent Tasks
Custom VSTS Agent Tasks I have created for demos and personal use.

# You no longer have to download and manually add these tasks to your account. They are now available from the [Visual Studio Team Services Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSTS?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dbrown).  The extension is called [Trackyon Advantage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Trackyon.trackyonadvantage&WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dbrown).

The SqlPackageTask is only here for education. It was adopted by the [Visual Studio Team Services](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/SqlAzureDacpacDeployment) team and now is in the box.

The SqlPackageTask requires a [Web API that simply returns the IP of the caller](http://www.donovanbrown.com/post/2015/05/15/i-need-my-external-ip-in-my-powershell). This is required to set the firewall rules in Azure. The WebOps project can be built using Visual Studio 2015 and hosted in a free Azure Web App. The directions on how to upload these tasks to your Visual Studio Team Services account are on [DonovanBrown.com](http://donovanbrown.com).

If you have questions ping me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/donovanBrown).
